# Dependabot configuration for KMP project
# IMPORTANT: KMP dependencies require coordinated updates - individual version
# bumps break multiplatform builds. Security updates are handled via Gradle
# resolutionStrategy.force() in build.gradle.kts.
#
# This config disables automatic version PRs to prevent failing CI.
# Security alerts are still reported in the Security tab.
